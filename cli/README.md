# ApiFirst generator

This folder provides a couple of generators which lets you get started with
building a decoupled Drupal site:

- generator-form: This generates a working form component from a given entity type, bundle and form mode
- generator-view: This generates a working view component from a given entity type, bundle and view mode

It leverages some mapping between formatters/widgets and react components placed defined in ```form.mapping.json```
and ```view.mapping.json```.

## TODOs

- Find better name
- Use a proper template engine (markup-js is sad)
- Provide complete form state management

- Support multivalue fields in view
- Support multivalue fields in form

- Provide view and form components for much more components.

- more ...
- Use some eslint configuration

## Development
